## A Pilot and Operator Perspective

When an airport has more than one FBO, the decision process is usually fast and practical.

Pilots and operators start with availability. Is the FBO open when I need it? Can they handle my aircraft type? Is fuel available without complications?

From there, the decision narrows based on experience and information.

One of the biggest factors is ease of arrival. Clear ramp instructions, visible signage, and responsive radio communication reduce stress. FBOs that make arrivals smooth leave a strong impression.

Next is service consistency. Pilots value predictability. An FBO that delivers a reliable experience every time will often be chosen over one that is occasionally excellent but inconsistent.

Amenities matter, but mostly as a reflection of professionalism. Clean facilities signal attention to detail. Functional crew lounges show respect for flight crews. Efficient transportation options show that the operation understands time pressure.

**Digital presence plays a bigger role than many FBOs realize. Before arriving, pilots often check:**

- Fuel pricing or programs
- Photos of the facility
- Reviews from other pilots
- Contact information and hours

If that information is missing or outdated, it creates uncertainty. Uncertainty leads pilots to choose the safer option, which is often the FBO with clearer information.
The best FBO on a field is usually the one that removes friction at every step, from online research to engine shutdown.
