## Why General Agencies Usually Miss the Mark

Most marketing agencies are not bad at what they do. They’re just not built for FBOs.

An FBO operates in a unique environment. Customers may never see your advertising. They may never follow you on social media. In many cases, they won’t even visit your website unless they are actively planning a stop.

That changes everything.

General agencies tend to focus on awareness, branding language, and long customer journeys. FBO marketing is much more compressed. A pilot or dispatcher might have minutes, not days, to decide where to stop. They are scanning for facts, not stories.

**Specialized FBO marketing starts with understanding where decisions actually happen:**

- ForeFlight airport pages
- AirNav listings
- Google Maps and search results
- Word of mouth among pilots and operators

If your agency doesn’t understand how those platforms work or how pilots use them, they’re guessing.

Another issue is terminology and accuracy. Aviation customers notice mistakes quickly. Incorrect runway references, outdated hours, missing fuel details, or vague amenities can immediately reduce confidence.

Specialized marketing respects the intelligence of the audience. It prioritizes accuracy, clarity, and consistency over cleverness.

FBOs don’t need to be sold to. They need to be understood. Marketing that reflects that difference performs better almost every time.
